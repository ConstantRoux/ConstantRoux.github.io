# Abstract
This paper presents a novel controller for the bipedal robot Bolt. Our approach leverages a whole-body model predictive controller in conjunction with a footstep sequencer to achieve robust locomotion. Simulation results demonstrate effective velocity tracking as well as push and slippage recovery abilities. In addition to that, we provide a theoretical sensitivity analysis of the footstep sequencing problem to enhance the understanding of the results.
