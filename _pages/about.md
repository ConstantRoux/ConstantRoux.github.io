I am a PhD student in the [Gepetto team](https://www.laas.fr/public/fr/gepetto) at [LAAS-CNRS](https://www.laas.fr), under the supervision of [Olivier Stasse](https://homepages.laas.fr/ostasse/hugo/) and [Philippe Sou√®res](https://gepettoweb.laas.fr/index.php/Members/PhilippeSou%C3%A8res). My PhD will focus on **reinforcement learning for the loco-manipulation of bipedal robots using imitation learning**.

I graduated from the engineering school [UPSSITECH](https://www.upssitech.eu/) in 2024 with a specialization in Robotic and Interactive Systems (SRI). Find more about my education in the [CV](https://constantroux.github.io/cv/) section of this site.

## Publications
My publications from my current PhD are available [here](https://constantroux.github.io/publications/).

## Teaching
During my PhD, I have the opportunity to have a first grasp on teaching computer science, and supervised learning in higher education.
